# gatk4-cnn-variant-filter

### Purpose :
This repo provides workflows that takes advantage of GATKs CNN tool which is a deep learning 
approach to filter variants based on Convolutional Neural Networks. 

Please read the following discussion to learn more about the CNN tool: [Deep Learning in GATK4](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/10996/deep-learning-in-gatk4).

### cram2filtered.wdl
This workflow takes an input CRAM/BAM to call variants with HaplotypeCaller
then filters the calls with the CNNVariant neural net tool using the filtering model specified.

The site-level scores are added to the `INFO` field of the VCF. The architecture arguments,
`info_key` and `tensor_type` arguments MUST be in agreement (e.g. 2D models must have
`tensor_type` of `read_tensor` and `info_key` of `CNN_2D`, 1D models have `tensor_type` of
`reference` and `info_key` of `CNN_1D`). The `INFO` field key will be `1D_CNN` or `2D_CNN`
depending on the neural net architecture used for inference. The architecture arguments
specify pre-trained networks. New networks can be trained by the GATK tools: CNNVariantWriteTensors 
and CNNVariantTrain. The CRAM could be generated by the [single-sample pipeline](https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-data-processing/blob/master/processing-for-variant-discovery-gatk4.wdl).
If you would like test the workflow on a more representative example file, use the following 
CRAM file as input and change the scatter count from 4 to 200: gs://gatk-best-practices/cnn-h38/NA12878_NA12878_IntraRun_1_SM-G947Y_v1.cram.

#### Requirements/expectations :
 - CRAM/BAM
 - BAM Index (if input is BAM) 

#### Output :
 - Filtered VCF and its index. 

### cram2model.wdl
This optional workflow is for advanced users who would like to train a CNN model for filtering variants. 

#### Requirements/expectations :
 - CRAM
 - Truth VCF and its index
 - Truth Confidence Interval Bed

#### Output :
 - Model HD5
 - Model JSON
 - Model Plots PNG

### run_happy.wdl
This optional evaluation and plotting workflow runs a filtering model against truth data (e.g. [NIST Genomes in a Bottle](https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/giab_latest_release), [Synthic Diploid Truth Set](https://github.com/lh3/CHM-eval/releases) ) and plots the accuracy.

#### Requirements/expectations :
 - File of VCF Files
 - Truth VCF and its index
 - Truth Confidence Interval Bed

#### Output :
 - Evaluation summary
 - Plots

### Software version notes :
